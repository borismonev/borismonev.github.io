        <h2>Programming experience</h2>
        <p>In the welcoming message on the main page of my website, I say that this is my first website ever,
          and that is true. The only experience I have had before starting the ICT programme was almost 6
          years ago, when I went to an extracurricular course about game development. Firstly, there the
          programming language that we used was JavaScript. I don't remember anything from JavaScript and
          thats why I did not implement it into my website. I learned HTML and CSS from the FreeCodeCamp
          website, and in two weeks time this is the result. I think I did a good job. I wanted to spend more
          time on the design while not sacrificing the functionality of the website. I have knowledge in
          Photoshop, which I used to change the color of the HZ logo and some of the images, so that they fit
          the theme of the website. I had a lot of fun, it was very interesting, and I am super excited to
          continue learning how to code!</p>
