        <h2>First feedback</h2>
        <p> The first feedback I received was about my website project and it was fairly positive. The
          compliments I received about it include the good colour pallete that I chose, which I ended up
          using, because of my CV which has a similar color scheme. Also reviewers liked the structure of my
          website, the layout and the different pages. Another compliment was that my code was organized and
          clean of any problems. Overall I was told I did a good job, which felt very rewarding after spending
          a lot of time working on this project</p>
        <p> Some website improvements that were suggested were to fix the spacing between the bottom of the page
          and the footer. Another thing was to make the GitHub icon in the footer functional. Other suggestion
          was to seperate the different html files for the pages and the articles into different folders to
          make it easier to find and navigate through the file explorer. Changing the names of the articles
          was another suggestion, because previously I had them named article1, article2, etc. which is not
          great, especially if in the future I would want to edit them I wouldn't know which one is which.
          Lastly was to change some information in the dashboard, because it was not correct and another was
          to add more pictures to the gallery. All of these things are suggestions from the feedback I
          received on pitch day and all have been implemented into the website!</p>
        <p> Overall most of the feedback was positive and there were just tiny things that needed to be tweaked
          to complete the website. It was a great experience and I learnt a lot!</p>
