                <h2>SWOT analysis</h2>
                <p> First I am going to talk about the strengths that I think I have. Confidence is definitely not one
                    of them, but I will talk more about that later. I believe one of my strengths is being a good
                    listener. I prefer to talk less and listen more to others, because I learn a lot from what other
                    people have to say on a certain topic and make a conclusion of their views. I then think about what
                    I agree and disagree with. I learn a lot from watching others and I try to apply my observations to
                    improve myself. I would also say I am an organized person. I like to keep my space tidy, because in
                    a way it boosts my productivity and helps me feel better, because I know where everything is and I
                    don't waste time trying to search for stuff.</p>
                <p> Now for my weaknesses. Like I mentioned, confidence isn't really a strength of mine. I've been
                    trying to push myself to get out of my comfort zone, which has definitely helped boost my
                    confidence. Another weakness of mine is having a hard time focusing on certain things that are
                    important, but don't interest me. For example doing homework. Sometimes I enjoy it a lot, but other
                    times I try to sit down and do what I have to do, but it takes me a long time, because I can't
                    focus. But I try to push through and complete the given assignment. </p>
                <p>Now about the opportunities that I see. A question I don't understand fully, but I will try my best
                    to answer. I would say that I make smart decisions and I never pass on opportunities such as, for
                    example studying abroad, or getting a job. I try to be quick in my decision-making because it may
                    result in either losing an opportunity or gaining one. I try to figure out the different options I
                    have and make the choice that is the most benefitial. </p>
                <p>The threats that I see. Another question I don't exactly know how to answer, but I will try. If we
                    are talking about social life a threat I see is connecting with people who only pull me down and
                    play no benefitial role in my life. Social media is a big threat in my opinion and I have always
                    stayed away from it, and have only used it to share things with a small circle of friends. I most of
                    the time can sense if things are wrong and I try to stay away from troublesome people or situations
                    that would have a negative impact on me and the people I care about.</p>
